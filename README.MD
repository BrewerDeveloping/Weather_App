# BrewingWeather - The weather app you didn't know you needed!

## About the app
BrewingWeather will be built utilizing at least 2 APIS, a front end using React, and the backend using Django.

Here is my current thought process for my layout of the app.

- Pages
  - LandingPage 
      - A page that shows a login screen that allows a existing user to log in or creeate a new user. Using a Username and password. In the event that the user is already existing I want to ask the user to signup. All this info needs to be sent/stored in the database and queried upon submission.

  - HomePage
      - A page that shows weather based on the 'home' location set by the user.
